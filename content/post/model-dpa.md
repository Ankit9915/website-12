Cari Spivack, our collaboarator on this framework, has worked with U.S. Digital Response to publish a Model Data Protection Agreement to help ensure an appropriate balance between those who produce data for these apps and those who use data produced by these apps. It is a great practical way to understand how our privacy framework fits into a tactical approach to launching Contact Tracing and Exposure Notification apps.
