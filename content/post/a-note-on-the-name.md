Based on a lot of feedback and a rapidly changing ecosystem, we have changed the name of these systems from "Digital Contact Tracing and Alerting" to "{{< term >}}." This  represents what these apps do and is a clearer break from Manual Contact Tracing. If you want more information, please read Harper Reed's [blog post on the naming](https://harper.blog/2020/04/22/digital-contact-tracing-and-alerting-vs-exposure-alerting/).
