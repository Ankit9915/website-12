## Other notable privacy principles

It is worth noting that we stand on the shoulders of those who came beforehand. We found that a lot of folks were defining similar data frameworks and we were happy to see that we share a lot of ideas. We found the following very helpful and influential: 

  * [CCC: 10 requirements for the evaluation of "Contact Tracing" apps](https://www.ccc.de/en/updates/2020/contact-tracing-requirements)
  * [COVID-19 Contact Tracing Privacy Principles](https://law.mit.edu/pub/covid19contacttracingprivacyprinciples)
  * [Recommendations on Privacy and Data Protection in the Fight Against COVID-19](https://www.accessnow.org/cms/assets/uploads/2020/03/Access-Now-recommendations-on-Covid-and-data-protection-and-privacy.pdf)
  * [Principles for Technology-Assisted Contact-Tracing](https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/field_document/aclu_white_paper_-_contact_tracing_principles.pdf) from ACLU
